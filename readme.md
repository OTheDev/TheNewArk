# The New Ark Project

An interactive sculpture created by the artist, Director Jacq. Users visit a
[site](https://www.thenewark.art), enter any sequence of 12 unique notes from a
one-octave keyboard, and the sculpture plays a randomly-generated, on-the-fly
composition, using the entered notes as a seed.

I was responsible for implementing the programs on the computer (controls the
sound; Python) and microcontroller (controls the lights; Arduino), both of
which live inside the Ark.
