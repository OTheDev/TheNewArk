# The New Ark Project

[The New Ark](https://www.artcandie.com/project-new-ark-director-jacq) is an 
interactive sculpture created by the artist, Director Jacq. Users visit a
[site](https://www.thenewark.art), enter any sequence of 12 unique notes from a
one-octave keyboard, and the sculpture plays a randomly-generated, on-the-fly
composition, using the entered notes as a seed.

I was responsible for implementing the programs on the computer (controls the
sound; Python) and microcontroller (controls the lights; Arduino/C++), both of
which live inside the Ark.

This is only one piece of a larger project by [BlockchainLabs](
https://www.blockchainlabs.ai). The sound samples and the music logic are by
[Patrick Davies](https://www.facebook.com/patrickdaviesmusic).
